# Parking-Lot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shailrshah/Parking-Lot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shailrshah/Parking-Lot)

This repository contains my implementation of a parking lot. The system allows cars to be parked and removed from the parking lot. It also allows dynamic addition and removal of parking spots in the parking lot.

Java 8, design patterns, and TDD have been leveraged in this project. Continuous Integration is made possible by TravisCI. Feel free to send feedback at acad.shail@gmail.com. Thanks!
